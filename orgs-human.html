    <h1>Favorite Humanistic Organizations</h1>

    <p>
I have been immensely privileged to have found and
participated with a number of organizations
which are engaged in powerfully creating and spreading humanistic values and New Culture.
    </p>

<h2>  These organizations have some common denominators: </h2>

<dl>
			<dt>Minimal Belief Systems</dt>
			<dd> <p>
These organizations do not have things we need to believe in order to
participate.  They are likely to question any rigid beliefs we
have which get in our way.  They leave it up to us whether and how we
want to modify or discard any of our beliefs.
			</p></dd>
			<dt>Non-Coercive</dt>
			<dd> <p>
How we choose to life our life is always up to
us, as long as we give others that same freedom.
	</p></dd>
			<dt>Honoring the Dignity of Each Person</dt>
			<dd> <p>
We are unconditionally respected as a human being.
			</p></dd>
			<dt>Inclusive Diversity</dt>
			<dd> <p>
All of these organizations have an appreciation for human diversity, including 
diversity of Gender, Appearance, Ethnicity, Culture, Points of View, Sexuality,
etc.  These organizations actively work to create a safe space for people to
express their diversity and to welcome diverse new people.
</p></dd>

<h2>  Here are some I recommend highly: </h2>

    <dl>
      <dt> <a href="http://hai.org" target="_blank">The Human Awareness
	  Institute</a></dt>
      <dd> <p>
	  Facilitating awareness around the fundamental human concerns of
	  Love, Intimacy, Sexuality and more.  I have increased joy and love
	  in my life through participating in HAI's workshops and in
	  their intern program.
      </p></dd>
      <dt> <a href="http://landmarkeducation.com" target="_blank">Landmark
	  Education</a></dt>
      <dd> <p>
	  Landmark's programs provide an extraordinary training in
	  being human.  I've gotten more out of my participation with
		Landmark's programs than I have from my participation with
 		any other organization.  At the same time, Landmark's programs
		have enhanced the value I've gotten out of the programs of
		other organizations and my life experience in general.
      </p></dd>
      <dt>
				<a href="http://www.nfnc.org" target="_blank">
					Network for a New Culture
				</a>
			</dt>
			<dd> <p>
				We are born into an existing culture.  As we gain life experience
				we co-create New Culture for ourselves and those who would
				accept the gift.  NFNC's Summer Camp programs give us an
				opportunity to live in New Culture for a few weeks a year and
				bring it back into our home community.
	 </p></dd>
      <dt>
				<a href="http://mankindproject.org" target="_blank">
					The Mankind Project
				</a>
			</dt>
			<dd> <p>
				The Mankind Project provides experiential programs
				for men to explore what it means to be a man without
				the baggage from our past.  There's a sister organization
				<a href="http://womanwithin.org" target="_blank">
					Woman Within International
				</a>
			 </p></dd>
      <dt>
				<a href="http://www.cnvc.org" target="_blank">
					Compassionate (Non-Violent) Communication
				</a>
			</dt>
			<dd> <p>A superb model for communication and
conflict-resolution.  I highly recommend attending some
Compassionate Communication training seminars.</p></dd>
      <dt>
				<a href="http://www.burningman.com" target="_blank">
					Burning Man
				</a>
			</dt>
			<dd> <p>
				Burning Man is both an immersive annual experience at a
				festival in Nevada and a global culture with festivals
				and vibrant community all over the world.  It's my favorite
 				community in which to practice and co-create New Culture.
