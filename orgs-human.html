        <h1>Favorite Humanistic Organizations</h1>

        <p>
            I have been immensely privileged to have found and
            participated with a number of organizations
            which are engaged in powerfully creating and spreading humanistic values and New Culture.
        </p>

        <h2>  These organizations have some common denominators: </h2>

        <dl>
            <dt>Minimal Belief Systems</dt>
            <dd> <p>
                These organizations do not have things we need to believe in order to
                participate.  They are likely to question any rigid beliefs we
                have which get in our way.  They leave it up to us whether and how we
                want to modify or discard any of our beliefs.
            </p></dd>
            <dt>Non-Coercive</dt>
            <dd> <p>
                How we choose to life our life is always up to
                us, as long as we give others that same freedom.
            </p></dd>
            <dt>Honoring the Dignity of Each Person</dt>
            <dd> <p>
                We are unconditionally respected as a human being.
            </p></dd>
            <dt>Inclusive Diversity</dt>
            <dd> <p>
                All of these organizations have an appreciation for human diversity, including
                diversity of Gender, Appearance, Ethnicity, Culture, Points of View, Sexuality,
                etc.  These organizations actively work to create a safe space for people to
                express their diversity and to welcome diverse new people.
            </p></dd>

        <h2>  Here are some I recommend highly: </h2>

        <dl>
            <dt> <a href="http://hai.org" target="_blank">The Human Awareness
                Institute</a></dt>
            <dd> <p>
                Facilitating awareness around the fundamental human concerns of
                Love, Intimacy, Sexuality and more.  I have increased joy and love
                in my life through participating in HAI's workshops and in
                their intern program.
            </p></dd>
            <dt> <a href="https://www.landmarkworldwide.com/" target="_blank">Landmark
                Worldwide</a></dt>
            <dd> <p>
                Landmark's programs provide an extraordinary training in
                being human.  I've gotten more out of my participation with
                Landmark's programs than I have from my participation with
                any other organization.  At the same time, Landmark's programs
                have enhanced the value I've gotten out of the programs of
                other organizations and my life experience in general.
            </p></dd>
            <dt>
                <a href="http://www.networkfornewculture.org" target="_blank">
                    Network for a New Culture (NFNC)
                </a>
            </dt>
            <dd> <p>!
                We are born into an existing culture.  As we gain life experience
                we co-create New Culture for ourselves and those who would
                accept the gift.  NFNC's Summer Camp programs give us an
                opportunity to live in New Culture for a few weeks a year and
                bring it back into our home community.
            </p></dd>
            <dt>
                <a href="http://mankindproject.org" target="_blank">
                    The Mankind Project
                </a>
            </dt>
            <dd> <p>
                The Mankind Project provides experiential programs
                for men to explore what it means to be a man without
                the baggage from our past.  There's a sister organization
                <a href="http://womanwithin.org" target="_blank">
                    Woman Within International
                </a>
            </p></dd>
            <dt>
                <a href="http://www.cnvc.org" target="_blank">
                    Compassionate (Non-Violent) Communication
                </a>
            </dt>
            <dd> <p>A superb model for communication and
                conflict-resolution.  I highly recommend attending some
                Compassionate Communication training seminars.</p></dd>
            <dt>
                <a href="http://www.burningman.com" target="_blank">
                    Burning Man
                </a>
            </dt>
            <dd> <p>
                Burning Man is both an immersive annual experience at a
                festival in Nevada and a global culture with festivals
                and vibrant community all over the world.  It's my favorite
                community in which to practice and co-create New Culture.
