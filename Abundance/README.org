* Abundance

Abundance is the unifying idea behind nearly everything I'm up to in my life.

I will soon have some wonderful material on Abundance which I'd like to
inspire you to read, and I know that it's often easier to get into a rich
topic with an audio or audiovisual introduction.

Therefore, I'm working on [[file:Presentations/README.org][Some Audiovisual Presentations!]] They're currently in
draft form - would you like to give me some feedback to assist in their
development?
