* Touch Website and Git Home STATUS and ROADMAP

** STATUS

The old Website has been moved to my Github account.  Many new
materials are now there in other repositories.

** ROADMAP

How to move my intent forwards:

- Create a README.org
- Point Puuhonua.Org at something on Github
- Link to my Touch Website and key GitHub resources from Puuhonua.Org
- Translate my web pages to OrgMode pages
- Create a script providing an adequate translation from OrgMode pages to WebPages
- Replace all or most of my webpages with translations of my OrgMode Pages
- Rationalize the storage of my WebPages and OrgMode pages on Github
- Move all of my resources to a WicciSpace server under my domains
