* Immortality: Frequently Asked Questions

** What does "Being Immortal" mean?

Some simple criteria for Immortality might include
- You don't age
- You can't easily be killed
- Any injuries you've sustained can be fully healed
  - Including pre-immortality aging damage

Some very desirable criteria might include
- The quality of your life is undiminished by aging.
- Your capacities can grow and develop indefinitely.
  - This includes maturity and wisdom.
- You are part of a wonderful immortal society.
  - This includes unlimited opportunities for love.

What criteria would you find desirable in an immortal life?
- For you as an individual?
- For a society of immortals?

** Is it possible to become immortal?

Definitely, and through many pathways.
- The earliest secure pathway is through [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_nanotechnology][Molecular Nanotechnology]]
- Everything changes when we reach the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity][Intelligence Singularity]]

** Is Molecular Nanotechnology really possible?

Every cell in your body and in every other living organism
- Contains molecular nanotechnolgy machines called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome][Ribosomes]]

While we could achieve immortality through genetic engineering and
other biological hacks, ribosomes can only build protein structures
which makes purely biological hacks limited.  Although the proteins
created by ribosomes can be used to create more general kinds of
structures, a more desirable molecular nanotechnology would use
Molecular Assemblers which could directly work with molecules of all
(reasonably stable) atomic isotopes.  Creating molecular assemblers is
an ambitious engineering project but it requires no breakthroughs in
physics. The plan is to use the first simple molecular assemblers to
create more sophisticated and specialized molecular assemblers and so
on, in a (controlled) self-reproducing exponential expansion of
capability.

** Is an Intelligence Singularity possible?

An Intelligence Singularity is [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/overdetermined][overdetermined]].  It could begin with
- An AI system that is better at creating AIs than human programmers are.
  - This could be a very narrowly intelligent system.
- A primitive but powerful brain/computer link
  - Uniting the best features of humans and computers.
  - Allowing high-bandwidth networks of such intelligences!
- A powerful [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_amplification][Augmentation of Intellect]] System
  - Less invasive than a brain/computer link.
  - Same ultimate effect, but perhaps slower to evolve.
  - Most of today's human/computer interfaces are not very powerful
    - They are driven by marketing considerations
      - Computer games, social networking, office tasks, etc.
  - We know how to build much more powerful systems!
    - ==> Let us know if you'd like to collaborate on this!!
- Using biotechnology to hack the human brain.
  - Leveraging [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savant_syndrome][Savant skills]] and expanding human genius.
  - Building a brain/computer interface from the brain-side.
- Using nanotechnology to build
    - Vastly more powerful computers.
    - Perfect brain/computer interfaces, bottom-up.

All of the developments above would support one another.  All of these
pathways can be replicated to produce great numbers of
super-intelligent systems.  The early super-intelligent systems would
create more super-intelligent systems which would be capable of
creating still more intelligent systems, and so on, eventually
(perhaps quickly) greatly exceeding the cognitive capacities of any
human or group of humans.

This creates a singularity because the unaugmented human beings of
today cannot extrapolate what a society of super-intelligences would
understand, discover, find interesting or be up to.  The only way to
understand the singularity is to live long enough to be part of it!

We can't (by definition) predict what life would actually be like
after an intelligence singularity, but we can "predict" a number of
the things that would be /possible/ in such a world.  These
"predictions" can give a sense of just how awesome such a world would
be, in the original sense of the word, i.e. inspiring awe.  The reason
these "predictions" are not "real" predictions is because the
super-human inhabitants of such a world might have ideas that go far
beyond our wildest "predictions" - literally beyond what we /can/
imagine!  Yet our primitive imaginings of what might be possible are
enough to have many of us yearn to live long enough to see that new
world!

** Could Immortality Be Sustainable?

An immortal society would not be sustainable if it
- was limited to one planet
- and continued to use traditional human bodies
  - with all of the resource needs of such bodies
- and added new bodies faster than they were discarded

There are many possible solutions to these constraints!
- Can you think of some?
